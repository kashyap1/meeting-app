# Meeting App

 - We are using json-server in the App. The database would be available in the ```server/db.json``` directory. Users can be added/modified/removed from the db.json.

 - We are using credentials stored in db.json to login. The session is maintained using a cookie. It can be moved to server, if APIs are created.(admin/admin can be used as credentials )

 - Download files using Git
 - Install node_modules
```npm install```

 - Run project
```npm run start```
